<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>m.printws</em> adds a quick '<b>print w</b>ork<b>s</b>pace'
function to GRASS GIS. Its purpose is to read a saved workspace file
and render its content into a bitmap or PDF file similar to what the
user configured in the workspace file for screen display, originally.
As an opposite to other methods, the user is not required to create a separate map definition.
<p>
The module creates bitmap files so it is <b>not suitable to produce professional cartographic quality</b>.
However, the following usage scenarios are recommended:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get a high resolution bitmap or PDF copy of a workspace composition to send in e-mail or include in office documents.
</li>
<li>Produce a quick printable page of the current screen composition.
</li>
<li>Use the main GRASS GIS window as a mapset composer. Supporting multiple displays whole mapset compositions
could be saved as normal workspaces and printed in one run. Being a regular GRASS script it could be called from other
scripts and command line as well. Even no GUI is necessary for it to run since it processes saved workspace files.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The module is set up to run with a full set of default values. To get quick result
it is enough to specify the workspace file as input and the name of the output file without its exentsion
since it is added autmatically depending on the selected output format. It creates a PDF format A4 landscape
page at 150 dpi as default. Margins are 25mm, map area is 1000mm. Map frame is centered between the margins.
<p>
When selecting font, font names visible to GRASS GIS are not self evident. To ease font selection an "*" can be used to ask
the script to look for a matching font. For example: <em>titlefont="Open*"</em> should find OpenSans or similar variations.
<p>
While running, the module modifies the map area edges ratio according to the region edges ratio.
It also reduces the map area to fit between margins.
It means that even faulty settings are corrected automatically.
<b>This is why initial settings of 1000mm map size and -1,-1 placement results an optimally filled and fitted page.</b>
<p>
When reducing the target dpi resolution the content gerenation is very fast.
It is recommended to run tests around 100dpi or lower and once we are satisfied with the layout
it is time to set the final target dpi.
<p>
The module tries to render everything what are checked on the layer list and also adds overlays like barscale,
legend and north arrow<b>*</b> <p>

<small><i><b>*=as of July 2016 overlay modules positioning is buggy when rendering to file...</b></i></small>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Some <b>drawbacks</b> of the module which should be taken into consideration:
<ul>
<li>Depending on the number of layers with opacity lower than 100% the number of
temporarily generated files may increase. An A4 300 dpi page consumes ~33MB
disk space and when joining the layers all these are read into memory or swapped
to disk by ImageMagick. Using many transparent layers, higher page size or higher
resolution may slows down processing. Please check you system monitor while the module
runs to follow memory and disk consumption. <b>The default 150 dpi</b> is good for testing compositions
meanwhile also saves disk space and processing time. 300 dpi or more is recommended for production printouts only.
</li>
<li>Font size of <b>label files</b> is not fitted yet to the dpi set by the user. Label
files should be regenerated to lower or higher font size according to dpi size.
Please consider that modern screens are around 100dpi or higher. If you render
300 dpi your labels should be drawn using 3 times bigger font size measured in dots.
</li>
</ul>
The module saves current region and sets it back when finished.

<h3>Multiple display support</h3>
When your workspace contains more than one display definitions m.printws would create multiple maps printing all displays on a
separate page in a separate file.
File naming is automatic and works like demonstrated blow if having to displays named 'Downtown' and 'OVERVIEW OF CITY':
<ul>
<li>File name entered for output: /path/to/file/outname.pdf</li>
<li>Generated map 1: /path/to/file/outname_DISPLAY_1_Downtown.pdf
</li>
<li>Generated map 2: /path/to/file/outname_DISPLAY_2_OVERVIEW OF CITY.pdf
</li>
</ul>
When regenerating the map the files are overwritten. Selecting a full name as output (outname_DISPLAY_2_Downtown.pdf)
the module will recognize its own additinons _DISPLAY_2_.... and .pdf and won't duplicate them in the newly generated filenames.
<h3>Tips and tricks</h3>
There is a macro possibility for titles.
<ul>
  <li>%DISPLAY% - as it is in the <b>title</b> field by default - in any of the text fields the name
of the corresponting display will be used for text.</li>
  <li>%USERNAME% - for user login name</li>
  <li>%TIME24% - 15:25:33</li>
  <li>%DATEYMD% - like 2016.08.02</li>
  <li>%DATEMDY% - like 08/02/2016</li>
  <li>%GXW% - name of the workspace file printed (full path)</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Windows specific settings for ImageMagick</h3>

ImageMagick (IM) is essential for merging createt map layers and convert to the desired format. On Windows,
IM should be installed by the user and be sure to add IM program directory to the PATH. It is done by the
IM installation program on windows. However, for GRASS GIS, the OSGeo4W environment should be changed.

Find the <em>o4w_env.bat</em> file in the OSGeo4W installation path. This is usually
under C:\OSGeo4W\bin.

Look at this part:

<div class="code"><pre>
REM start with clean path
set Path=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%WINDIR%\system32;%WINDIR%;%WINDIR%\WBem
</pre></div>

and put back Windows path or if there is a collision in your system, add only
IM path at the beginning (add %Path%; before the first occurence of %WINDIR%).

<div class="code"><pre>
REM start with clean path
set Path=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%Path%;%WINDIR%\system32;%WINDIR%;%WINDIR%\WBem
</pre></div>
Save the .bat file. Restart GRASS GIS after this change. To check whether IM is accessible, in the GRASS GIS
Layer Manager window click on <em>the Command console</em> tab and enter:
<div class="code"><pre>
magick convert
</pre></div>
If everything went fine, you will see the IM convert command help.
